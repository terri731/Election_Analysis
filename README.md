## Election Audit Summary
#### This script may be used for future elections. The PyPoll_challenge_starter_code.py file may be saved as another python file. The user would need to copy over the information in the "election_results.csv" file then run it again. Another solution would be to save another file in the Resources folder which contains the election_results.csv file. Save the new csv file with a new name and replace "election_results.csv" with the new file name.
